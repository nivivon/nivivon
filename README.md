### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Niv, and I've been using a computer since I was 3 years old. Being fortunate enough to have access to a computer early in life, I found it fascinating how I was able to connect to the entire world at a click of a button. Growing up, technology has been a big part of my life, whether it was by enabling me to listen to music, supporting me in automatically tracking my workouts, or connecting me with my friends.

Currently, I'm working at Wealthsimple, where I'm working on enabling the future majority to achieve financial freedom. I actually started around the time where I finally paid off my student loans. Wealthsimple helped me feel less stressed about finances by making investment so easy and accessible. I want to help others feel the same.

I'm a people driven software development leader who highly values:
- Empathy (for our clients, our team members, and all stakeholders)
- Transparency
- Over-communication
- Being growth driven
- Winning and failing as a team. Collaboration is key.
- Making sure everyone's voice is heard. It's how we make the best decisions.

Are you a software engineer? Please reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nivyahel/). Would love to chat.
