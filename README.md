### Hi there üëã

My name is Niv, and I've been using a computer since I was 3 years old. Being fortunate enough to have access to a computer early in life, I found it fascinating how I was able to connect to the entire world at a click of a button. Growing up, technology has been a big part of my life, whether it was by enabling me to listen to music, supporting me in automatically tracking my workouts, or connecting me with my friends.

Currently, I'm working at Wealthsimple, where I'm working on enabling the future majority to achieve financial freedom. I lead Money Movement, which helps make it fast and seamless to move your money into, between, and out of Wealthsimple accounts. I actually started around the time where I finally paid off my student loans. Wealthsimple helped me feel less stressed about finances by making investment so easy and accessible. I want to help others feel the same.

### My Management Values

üíù #empathy (For your clients, stakeholders, and your team)

We exist to help our clients achieve financial freedom. One of our values "the client, the client the client" is all about empathy for our clients and ensuring we go the extra mile. Our clients are why we exist, and as we strive to build the most human, financial institution, we must keep them top of mind.

Our stakeholders are our allies in our journey of doing what's right for our client. They provide us with autonomy, meaningful feedback, and a unifying voice to help us tie our objectives to Wealthsimple's vision. Empathy here is understanding that we have a common goal, and that when they seek to understand if there's a way we can "Ship it then iterate" (another one of our values), they're simply aiming to provide us with a different perspective.

Lastly, it's for your team. As a manager, you have the opportunity to shape your team's environment. You can help unlock your developers' potential, and the way you do that, is by leading with curiosity, creating a psychologically safe environment, and actively listening to their challenges and addressing them.

ü§ù Win as a #team, fail as a #team

There are places where an individual's output is tracked, which in my opinion, misses out on reviewing the system and how it fits together. When a project is successful, it's not just thanks to the DRI (Directly Responsible Individual), but thanks to all of the developers / designers / product managers / operations / client success folx that collaborated on making it a success. When bad code gets shipped to production, we conduct post-mortems to look at parts of our process, not individuals, in a blame-free way. I believe in optimizing for learning, and collaborating as a team to support each other's growth.

üîç #transparency

I am an extremely transparent leader. As I learn new information, refine the team org design, set new goals, I make sure to share early and often. This serves two purposes: it creates an avenue for everyone to share their thoughts so they can influence a decision as it's being formed, and it equips everyone with the most up-to-date information so they can make the best decision.

An example of this is the weekly department updates I share publicly with the entire department. This is my way of ensuring that everyone is not only aware of what others are working on, but know what decisions are being made, or what new information has uncovered. In each one, I solicit feedback to ensure that everyone has a voice.

üå± #growth driven

As a manager, you're uniquely positioned to ensure that not only does your team deliver, but that they get better with every quarter. The way I action this is by ensuring each developer has a development plan, and create opportunities to help them work towards their goals.

An example of what we do in Money Movement is [Speedback](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/30/business/karen-may-of-google-on-conquering-fears-of-giving-feedback.html) sessions, a meeting where we pair off and provide / receive feedback from each person on the team once a month, to explicitly get us to think about providing each other with continuous feedback. 100% of people who participated shared they enjoyed the session, and learned something new. I also personally provide weekly feedback to my direct reports to ensure we're constantly aligned.
